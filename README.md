# Supplementary material for the manuscript "Interpretable generative deep learning: an illustration with single cell gene expression data"

Here you can recaptiulate the application of LDVAE and log-linear models to single-cell RNA-Seq data as shown in the manuscript.
In [LDVAE_analysis.ipynb](LDVAE_analysis.ipynb) you find the application of LDVAE.
In [LogLinearModels.ipynb](LogLinearModels.ipynb) you find the application of the log-linear modeling approach.
Before using [LogLinearModels.ipynb](LogLinearModels.ipynb) you first have to run the notebook [PBMCscVI.ipynb](PBMCscVI.ipynb) for generating the synthetic observations.
